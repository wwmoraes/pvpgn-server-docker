## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Yet another [pvpgn-docker](https://github.com/search?q=pvpgn-docker) project.
Aims to be:

- ‚åõ time-proof - builds binaries directly from [source][pvpgn-server]
- üîê secure - uses non-privileged user and group to run the server
- üóú small - based on Alpine linux
- ‚öñ lightweight - final image doesn't contain source or build tools

[pvpgn-server]: https://github.com/pvpgn/pvpgn-server

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Pull the image from Docker Hub:

```sh
docker pull wwmoraes/pvpgn-server
```

Then/or just run:

```sh
docker run -it wwmoraes/pvpgn-server
```

PvPGN-PRO is built and installed on the root filesystem. A sample configuration
can be found at `/etc/pvpgn`. Data (logs, storage, scripts, etc) can be found
at `/var/pvpgn`. These are the default locations `bnetd` will use, unless you
configure it to use distinct paths.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

The configuration and data paths should be bound to volumes for persistence, and
the ports should be published so you can access the server outside of the
container:

```sh
docker run -it -p 6112:6112 -p 4000:4000 \
  -v <your-config-volume-or-path>:/etc/pvpgn \
  -v <your-data-volume-or-path>:/var/pvpgn \
  wwmoraes/pvpgn-server
```

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure the volumes/bind mount sources are readable and
writable by the server user and group. The image default is 1001.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The build is done with Lua script support enabled, and MySQL support for the
account backend.

You can create persistent local volumes for the config and data without starting
the server with:

```sh
docker run --rm --entrypoint=true \
  -v <your-config-volume-name>:/etc/pvpgn \
  -v <your-data-volume-name>:/var/pvpgn \
  wwmoraes/pvpgn-server
```

Both volumes must not exist prior to this call for Docker to create and populate
them with the image contents.

You can also copy the files to your host system using a temporary bind mount,
for instance:

```sh
mkdir {var,etc}

docker run --rm --entrypoint=cp --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v $PWD/var:/mnt/var \
  wwmoraes/pvpgn-server \
  -r /var/pvpgn /mnt/var

docker run --rm --entrypoint=cp --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v $PWD/etc:/mnt/etc \
  wwmoraes/pvpgn-server \
  -r /etc/pvpgn /mnt/etc
```

Please refer to the upstream documentation on how to configure your server.
